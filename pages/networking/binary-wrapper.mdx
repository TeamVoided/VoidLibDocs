# About

You may have noticed that packets take in a `BinaryFormat` so you cant use a format like `Json` or `Toml`

For that we provide the `BinaryWrapper` class

# Usage

To use the `BinaryWrapper` class, simply call its constructor with the `StringFormat` that you wish to use

Here's an example

```kotlin
val wrapper = BinaryWrapper(Json { })
```

The `BinaryWrapper` class is a `BinaryFormat` so you can use it in your packets
