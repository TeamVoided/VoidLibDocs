# Registering Your Config

Registering your config is actually pretty simple.

You simply have to call `ConfigManager#registerConfig` with your `VoidFig` passed as a parameter in your main entrypoint

Here's an example

```kotlin
//main entrypoint
fun commonSetup() {
    //pretend "VFig" is your `VoidFig` object
    ConfigManager.registerConfig(VFig)
}
```

Yep it's that simple
